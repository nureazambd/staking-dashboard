### Documentation:

Got here looking for the explorer Apps UI [(argoscan)](https://explorer.argoscan.net/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fexplorer.devolvedai.com#/explorer)? Just follow the preceding link. Looking for developer documentation? Then you are at the right place.

This is an effort to provide a collection of tools, utilities and libraries for interacting with the Polkadot network from JavaScript. All code is made available on [(GitHubs)](https://github.com/Devolved-AI/Argoscan)

While there is a slant towards developer tools, providing libraries to allow others to build tools on top of, a collection of applications are made available that allows for interaction with the network from a pure user perspective. The documentation contained here has a focus on the developer libraries.

If you are a end-user looking to interact with the network, you can interact with [(explorer.argoscan.net)](https://explorer.argoscan.net/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fexplorer.devolvedai.com#/explorer)

### 1. Overview
Purpose
The Argoscan Explorer is designed to offer a comprehensive view of the Argo and Substrate blockchains. It allows users to view real-time and historical data, including blocks, transactions, and network activities.

Target Audience
This documentation is intended for developers, validators, nominators, and general users who are interested in monitoring and interacting with the ArgoChain and Substrate blockchains.

### 2. Features
Real-Time Blockchain Data
Blocks: View details of the latest blocks and navigate through historical blocks.
Transactions: Inspect transactions included in each block, along with their statuses and details.
Events: Monitor system events triggered by blocks and transactions.
Network Insights
Staking Overview: Track staking dynamics, validator performance, and nominator allocations.
Governance: Follow governance proposals, referenda, and voting outcomes.
Treasury: Overview of treasury proposals and spendings.

### 3. Getting Started
Installation
No installation is required as ArgoChain Explorer is a web-based application. Users can access it directly through the link: https://explorer.argoscan.net/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fexplorer.devolvedai.com#/explorer

Configuration
Network Selection: Users can switch between different networks (e.g., ArgoChain, ArgoExplorer) using the network selector at the top left corner.
Account Setup: Users can import or create a new wallet directly within the interface to interact with the blockchain.

### 4. How to Use
Viewing Blocks and Transactions
Navigate to the 'Explorer' tab: This is the default landing page.
Select a block: Click on any block to view detailed information.
Explore transactions: Transactions within the block are listed; clicking on them will provide more details.
Participating in Governance
Navigate to the 'Governance' tab.
Review Proposals: Users can view active proposals, referenda, and participate in the voting if they have an active account connected.

### 5. Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Connection Issues: Ensure that your internet connection is stable and that the Polkadot.js Explorer is not undergoing maintenance.
Data Delay: Occasionally, data displayed might not be real-time due to network delays. Refreshing the page generally resolves this.

### 6. Additional Resources
